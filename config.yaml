      text: GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition) aims to fill in the gaps by ingesting software metadata, like SBOMs, and mapping out relationships between software. When you know how one piece of software affects another, youâ€™ll be able to fully understand your software security position and act as needed.

      logo: trustify.png
      text: The Trustify project is a collection of software components that enables you to store and retrieve Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), and advisory documents. Developers can use this information to learn about common security vulnerabilities and dependency changes within their software supply chain.
