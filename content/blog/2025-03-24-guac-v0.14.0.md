GUAC [v0.14.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.14.0) is now
available. This release adds:

* [Kubescape](http://kubescape.io/) collector
  * See the [accompanying blog post]({{< relref "2025-03-24-kubescape.md" >}})
* Improvements to the ClearlyDefined certifier
  * Retry failed requests for more error codes
  * Improve Go package name translation
* Endpoint changes to REST API
  * Dependency search queries are now under the versioned “/v0/...” path
* Improvements to the End of Life certifier logic
  * The parsing of purls now uses standard helper methods and the check for
  whether a node has EOL data is now more specific to mitigate false positives
* Connect equivalent nodes representing container images with an IsOccurrence
  node.
