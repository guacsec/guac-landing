GUAC [v0.13.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.13.0) is now available.
This release adds supporting for optionally sending [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) metrics.
When using the `--enable-otel` command line switch, the following will publish to a user-specified OpenTelemetry server:

* HTTP GQL server in `guacgql`
* SQL library underneath the Ent/Postgres backend
* HTTP client for: OSV, ClearlyDefined, GitHub, endoflife.date
* GRPC client for Deps.dev

In addition, this release fixes two bugs related to missing flags in command line tools:

* `--add-eol-on-ingest` missing from `guacone` ([#2390](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/issues/2390))
* `--use-csub` missing from the OCI collector ([#2423](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/issues/2423))

The [v0.13.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.13.0) release page has full details of this release.
