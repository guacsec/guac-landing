GUAC [v0.12.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.12.0) is now available.
Version 0.12.0 brings new a certifier for endoflife.date, an OCI container registries, along with improvements to the OSV certifier.
Note that we also released version 0.12.1 to address a GitHub workflow issue with publishing the SBOM.


## End-of-Life certifier

A new certifier, contributed by Robbie Cronin, collects end-of-life information from the [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) service.
endoflife.date provides a central source information for information about when applications, libraries, and distributions reach the end of their support period.
Unsupported versions don't receive vulnerability fixes, so keeping your dependencies up-to-date is an important part of securing your software supply chain.

endoflife.date — both the web tooling and the data — are open source.
You can [contribute](https://endoflife.date/#contributing) if you have additional information to add.

## OCI collector

GUAC now supports collecting artifacts from a user-specified container registry.
Using the `guacone collect registry <RegistryURI>` command, you can pull SBOMs and attestations into GUAC registries compatible with the [Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).
This was also primarily contributed by Robbie Cronin.

## Other improvements

Lukas Hoehl contributed an enhancement to the [OSV certifier](https://docs.guac.sh/osv-certifier/).
When using the `--add-vuln-metadata` flag, GUAC adds vulnerability severity to a `VulnerabilityMetadata` node, allowing for improved vulnerability assessment and analysis within GUAC.

Information from `CertifyLegal` nodes is now included in the output of `guacone query known package`.

With the `--add-depsdev-on-ingest`, you can now query deps.dev when ingesting an SBOM.

In addition, this release contains other bug fixes and dependency updates.
The [v0.12.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.12.0) release page has full details of this release.
