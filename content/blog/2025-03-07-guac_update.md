Welcome to the [GUAC Update](/tags/guac-update), a monthly review of what has happened in the GUAC community and what's coming up.
If you have feedback, please [let us know]({{< relref "../community.md" >}}).
To include something in next month's update, leave a comment in the [issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-landing/issues/130).

It's been a relatively quiet month, but we have a few interesting things brewing.
Ria Farrell Schalnat spoke at the Community Meeting about how [she used GUAC and ClearlyDefined to improve license compliance](https://youtu.be/4wCFLl-1UNk?t=1224).
The maintainers continue to discuss plans for a new architecture.
And we're looking forward to evaluating GUAC against the newly-released [Open Source Project Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org).
