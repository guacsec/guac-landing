Welcome to the [GUAC Update](/tags/guac-update), a monthly review of what has happened in the GUAC community and what's coming up.
If you have feedback, please [let us know]({{< relref "../community.md" >}}).
To include something in next month's update, leave a comment in the [issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-landing/issues/104).

## New contributors

Thanks to the following people for making their first contributions in November
(the people listed here may have contributed to other parts of the project previously):

* [Anirudh Edpuganti](https://github.com/ANIRUDH-333): [guac#2307](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/pull/2307)

## Releases

With KubeCon and the US Thanksgiving holiday, activity slowed in November.
We still had a release for GUAC, though.
This release fixed a batch query where a nil query would return all values in the DB.

Full details for each release are below:

* [GUAC v0.11.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.11.2)

*Note: We do not typically publish blog posts for bugfix releases.*

## Events

If you couldn't make it to KubeCon in Salt Lake City, you can watch the recordings of Parth Patel and Mihai Maruseac presenting "[Papers, Please - Scrutinizing AI model creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UdO2b697kw)" at Cloud Native Rejekts.

GUAC also received a shout out in three different keynote talks:
* [Open Source Security is Not a Spectator Sport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqvjzsNmJZ8) — Justin Cappos and Santiago Torres Arias
* [A Developer's Guide to Securing Your Software Supply Chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQuzhSGGPNk) — Toddy Mladenov
* [Cloud Native's Next Decade: Stable, Secure, and...Ready for Disruption?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMIhdUiHPps) — Nikhita Raghunath
