Version 0.4.10 of the experimental [GUAC Visualizer](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer) is now available.
The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with GUAC services.
It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph and explore the supply chain.

The two main changes in version 0.4.10 were both contributed by [Martin W. Kirst](https://github.com/nitram509).
First, the Visualizer now displays the version of GUAC in use, as well as the Visualizer version.
Additionally, the container image is reduced from 1.69 GB to 1.07 GB.

GUAC Visualizer also contains updates to the GraphQL schema for the latest GUAC updates.
In addition, there are updates to the documentation and security improvements to the GitHub workflows.
See the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/releases/tag/v0.4.10) for a full list of changes.
It includes first-time contributions to the GUAC Visualizer from:
* [@SmashedFrenzy16](https://github.com/SmashedFrenzy16)
* [Martin W. Kirst](https://github.com/nitram509)

We'd love your help with GUAC Visualizer.
See the "[help wanted](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)" or "[good first issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)" tags in GitHub for suggestions.

You may notice that the previous GUAC Visualizer release was 0.4.5.
The "missing" release numbers are due to re-runs of the release workflow to diagnose and fix issues introduced by the security improvements.
