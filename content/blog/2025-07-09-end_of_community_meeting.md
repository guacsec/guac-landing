With the recent release of [GUAC 1.0]({{< relref "2025-06-12-guac-v1.0.md" >}}), the GUAC Maintainers have decided this is a good time to end the monthly community meetings.

When the project started, the monthly community meetings were the main venue for people interested in GUAC to have high-bandwidth discussion.
Users and contributed shared use cases, discussed design ideas, and sought help with using pre-1.0 GUAC.

Since the weekly maintainer meetings became public last year, we've seen a lot of community members join.
This seems to have come at the expense of topics and attendance for the community meeting.
It makes sense that if people have something to discuss, they'd rather do it at the next weekly meeting than to wait weeks for the next community meeting.
To us, that's a success.

The weekly maintainer meetings are staying put.
If you have something you want to discuss, you're always welcome to join on Mondays or ask in the #guac channel on the OpenSSF Slack.
See the [community page]({{< relref "../community.md" >}}) for details.
Notes from past community meetings will remain [available on GitHub](https://github.com/guacsec/governance/tree/main/meetings/community) and the recordings are on the [GUAC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ84exb50PQ&list=PL3pS03waoqbKrXyqvjSxj6Sr3AhmirwPf).
