GUAC [v0.11.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.11.0) is now available, with improved query capabilities.
You can now perform batch searches for `isDependency`, `CertifyVuln`, and `CertifyLegal` nodes via a package ID.
The following batch searches are now supported in GraphQL:

* `BatchQueryPkgIDCertifyLegal` — `CertifyLegal` nodes (licenses)
* `BatchQueryPkgIDCertifyVuln` — `CertifyVuln` nodes (known vulnerabilities)
* `BatchQuerySubjectPkgDependency` — `IsDependency` nodes that have the subject package ID
* `BatchQueryDepPkgDependency` — `IsDependency` nodes that have the dependency package ID

This new functionality enables easier reporting of common questions.
See the [v0.11.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.11.0) release page for full details of this release.
