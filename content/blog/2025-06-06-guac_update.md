Welcome to the [GUAC Update](/tags/guac-update), a monthly review of what has happened in the GUAC community and what's coming up.
If you have feedback, please [let us know]({{< relref "../community.md" >}}).
To include something in next month's update, leave a comment in the [issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-landing/issues/143).

We're putting the final touches on the GUAC 1.0 release.
As part of that, the Helm charts developed by Kusari are [now in the `guacsec` organization]({{< relref "2025-05-30-helm_chart_move.md" >}}).

The CNCF is looking at using GUAC to gain insights into the software supply chain across its wide portfolio of projects.
We're excited to work with them on this.
