Welcome to the [GUAC Update](/tags/guac-update), a monthly review of what has happened in the GUAC community and what's coming up.
If you have feedback, please [let us know]({{< relref "../community.md" >}}).
To include something in next month's update, leave a comment in the [issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-landing/issues/138).

We're putting the final touches on the GUAC 1.0 release.
Plus, we're working on merging with the Trustify project to create a unified effort to address the challenges of consuming, processing, and utilizing supply chain security metadata at scale.
Stay tuned for updates.
