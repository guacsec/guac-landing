The superpower of open source is multiple people working together on a common goal.
That works for projects, too. GUAC and Trustify are two projects bringing visibility to the software supply chain.
Today, they’re combining under the GUAC umbrella.
With Red Hat’s contribution of Trustify to the GUAC project, the two combine to create a unified effort to address the challenges of consuming, processing, and utilizing supply chain security metadata at scale.

## Why join?

The Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) project was created to bring understanding to software supply chains.
GUAC ingests software bills of materials (SBOMs) and enriches them with additional data to create a queryable graph of the software supply chain.
Trustify also ingests and manages SBOMs, with a focus on security and compliance. With so much overlap, it makes sense to combine our efforts.

The grand vision for this evolved community is to become the central hub within OpenSSF for initiatives focused on building and using supply chain knowledge graphs.
This includes: defining & promoting common standards, data models, & ontologies; developing shared infrastructure & libraries; improving the overall tooling ecosystem; fostering collaboration & knowledge sharing; and providing a clear & welcoming community for contributors.

## What’s next?

Right now, we’re working on the basic logistics: migrating repositories, updating websites, merging documentation.
We have created a new GUAC Steering Committee that oversees two core projects: Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC) and Trustify, and subprojects like sw-id-core and GUAC Visualizer.
These projects have their own [maintainers](https://github.com/guacsec/governance/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md), but we expect to see a lot of cross-collaboration as everyone gets settled in.

If you’d like to learn more, join Ben Cotton and Dejan Bosanac at [OpenSSF Community Day Europe](https://openssf.org/event/openssf-community-day-europe/) for their [talk](https://sched.co/25dGq) on Thursday 28 August.
If you can’t make it to Amsterdam, the [community page](https://guac.sh/community) has all of the ways you can engage with our community.
