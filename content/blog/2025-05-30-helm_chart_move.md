The GUAC [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) are now under the guacsec organization on GitHub.
You can find the Helm charts in [https://github.com/guacsec/helm-charts](https://github.com/guacsec/helm-charts).

If you have previously deployed GUAC using the Helm charts when they were hosted in the kusaridev organization, you will need to change any reference from the old location (`kusaridev/helm-charts`) to the new location (`guacsec/helm-charts`).
Consult the documentation for your tooling for specific instructions.

The [GUAC Docs](https://docs.guac.sh) have all been updated with the new location.
If you see anything incorrect in the docs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-docs/issues/new).
