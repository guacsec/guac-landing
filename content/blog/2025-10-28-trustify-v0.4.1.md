Trustify [v0.4.1](https://github.com/guacsec/trustify/releases/tag/v0.4.1) is now available.
This release provides a new recommendations API endpoint for PURLs to suggest updated package versions and related vulnerability remediations.

The new release also includes the features in the v0.4.0 release from earlier this month:

* **Enhanced SBOM Correlation:** Improved correlation for SBOMs, especially those without CPEs
* **Advanced License Filtering:** New filtering capabilities for SBOMs, PURLs, and a dedicated license list endpoint
* **Performance and Memory Improvements:** Analysis memory consumption has been reduced by approximately 15%, and caching has been improved
* **Expanded Vulnerability Scores:** Now includes scores from CVSSv4 and CVSSv2
* **Storage and GC Enhancements:** Added a garbage collection endpoint and improved the deletion process for SBOMs and advisories
