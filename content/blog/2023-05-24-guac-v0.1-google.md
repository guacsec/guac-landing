Today, we are announcing the launch of the v0.1 version of Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC).
Introduced at Kubecon 2022 in October, GUAC targets a critical need in the software industry to understand the software supply chain.
In collaboration with Kusari, Purdue University, Citi, and community members, we have incorporated feedback from our early testers to improve GUAC and make it more useful for security professionals.
This improved version is now available as an API for you to start developing on top of, and integrating into, your systems.
