[Version 0.6.0](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/releases/tag/v0.6.0) of the GUAC Visualizer is now available.
The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with GUAC services.
It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph and explore the supply chain.

Version 0.6.0 includes a fix for handling packages with an empty namespace.
It also improves reliability by using Next's native proxy functionality.
Of course, it also comes with dependency updates.

This release includes first-time contributions from:

* [@hidde-jan](https://github.com/hidde-jan)
* [@mcombuechen](https://github.com/mcombuechen)
* [@gaganhr94](https://github.com/gaganhr94)

With this release, we're also testing GitHub's Immutable Releases feature (currently in private preview).
When used, this feature prevents changing any artifacts after a release is published.
Post-release alteration of release contents is a common supply chain attack, so we're glad to be trying out a feature that will close off that threat.
You'll see the tag "ðŸ”’ Immutable" next to the timestamp in the release.

You may notice that the previous release was v0.14.10.
The v0.5.0 tag had been applied locally and was accidentally pushed alongside v0.6.0.
