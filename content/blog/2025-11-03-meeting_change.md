The GUAC Maintainer Meeting is switching from a weekly schedule to bi-weekly.
The next meeting will be Monday 17 November.
We're making this switch to better respect people's time as the meeting agendas have become smaller after the GUAC 1.0 release and Trustify merger.

You can always find the most up-to-date time and location of meetings on the [OpenSSF Calendar](https://openssf.org/getinvolved/).
Of course, the [GUAC public slack channel](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03U677QD46) is always open.
