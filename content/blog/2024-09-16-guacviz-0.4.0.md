Version 0.4.0 of the experimental [GUAC Visualizer](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer) is now available.
The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with GUAC services.
It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph and explore the supply chain.

The main change in version 0.4.0 is the addition of a new window that displays known information about a package.
This package information box, contributed by [Shafee Ahmed](https://github.com/shafeeshafee), gives you quick access to information about a package's vulnerabilities, SBOM source, and [SLSA](https://slsa.dev) attestations.

It includes first-time contributions to the GUAC Visualizer from [Ben Cotton](https://github.com/funnelfiasco), [Kris Borchers](https://github.com/kborchers), and [@haosanzi](https://github.com/haosanzi).
